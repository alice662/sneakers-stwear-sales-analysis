# Sneakers & Streetwear Sales Analysis
## Executive Summary

This project is based on a sales dataset for sneakers and streetwear. It includes different brands, product types, categories, countries, and payment modes. After cleaning and preparing the data, I built pivot tables and a dashboard.

The results show clear patterns: Casual and Streetwear are the most profitable categories, and Nike and Adidas are the strongest brands.



## Business Problem

The sneaker and streetwear industry is growing fast, but companies often face questions like:

* Which product categories bring the highest revenue?
* How do sales change month by month?
* Which payment methods do customers prefer?
* What is the difference in performance between men’s, women’s, and unisex products?

Finding answers to these questions is important for inventory planning, marketing strategy, and business growth.



## Methodology

* Data Cleaning: Changed raw data into a clean table, fixed missing or wrong values.
* Data Transformation: Created pivot tables to analyze sales by revenue, quantity, category, and payment method.
* Data Visualization: Built a dashboard to show monthly revenue, product categories, payment methods, and gender sales.
* Tools: Microsoft Excel (pivot tables, charts, dashboard).

## Results & Business Recommendation

* Revenue trend: July had the highest sales ($32,073), April had the lowest ($17,176).
* Categories: Casual (28%) and Streetwear (27%) together make almost half of all revenue.
* Payment methods: Wallet and Card together give more than 56% of revenue.
* Gender sales: Women’s products made the highest revenue ($78,150), followed by Men ($68,502) and Unisex ($46,450).
* Brands: Nike and Adidas lead the market. Smaller premium brands (like Off-White, Essentials) cover a smaller but valuable segment.

Recommendations:

* Focus more on Casual and Streetwear products.
* Grow the women’s product line.
* Support Wallet and Card payments with promotions.
* Keep Nike and Adidas strong in campaigns, but also highlight premium brands with higher unit prices.



## Next Steps

* Stock optimization: Increase stock for Casual and Streetwear, because they sell the most.
* Women’s segment growth: Add more women’s products, colors, and limited editions.
* Marketing focus: Ads should highlight Nike and Adidas, but also include premium brands like Off-White and Essentials.
* Payment support: Give small discounts or loyalty points for Wallet and Card payments, as these are most used.
* Seasonal actions: Run special campaigns in weak months like April to push sales.
